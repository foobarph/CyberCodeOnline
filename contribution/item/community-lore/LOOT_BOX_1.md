Yep, there's something rattling around in here and clearly valuable enough to warrant a bio-encryption lock. Giving it an EMF scan you're pretty sure that this controller from Synthcore or one of those Archtech runs with floating point errors would be great for bypassing older firmware on the hard drive - if only we had more time!
